Develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to create a digit recognizer system that can correctly identify digits ranging from 0 to 9 with high accuracy. The model should be capable of handling variations in writing styles and different pen strokes while achieving robust performance. The evaluation metric will be classification accuracy, measuring the percentage of correctly classified digits in the test dataset.![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
